                    <h3>Introduction: A Country Built on Memory</h3>
                    <p class="lead-text">The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina left deep scars in its society, visible through its urban fabric. As Yugoslavia disintegrated, long-standing multi-ethnic communities fractured along nationalist lines.</p>
                    
                    <p class="lead-text">What followed was one of Europe's most devastating conflicts since World War II, with over 100,000 people killed, two million displaced and entire towns and cities destroyed. The war tore through everyday life, not only with violence, but by dismantling the delicate social fabric that once held diverse communities together.</p>

                    <p class="image-caption">Building in Mostar pockmarked with bullet holes, left unrepaired.</p>
                    <p class="lead-text">Nearly three decades later, Bosnia and Herzegovina remains a post-conflict society, grappling with how to confront and remember its traumatic past. Nowhere is this more palpable than in the urban environments of Sarajevo and Mostar. These two cities experienced some of the war's most visible destruction and now serve as open-air archives of its legacy. Buildings are still pockmarked by bullet holes and explosives, some even partially destroyed and left to decay. Monuments have also been erected in silence or controversy. The architecture in Bosnia and Herzegovina tells a complex story of survival, loss and contested memory.</p>
                    
                    <p class="lead-text">This blog explores how architecture serves as a tool of remembrance in post-war Bosnia and Herzegovina. It draws on the framework of French historian Pierre Nora, who introduced the idea of <em>lieux de m√©moire</em>, or sites of memory. According to Nora, when societies can no longer rely on lived communal memory because of rupture, trauma or generational distance, they begin to embed memory in material forms such as buildings, ruins, memorials and symbolic spaces. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, narratives of the past remain politically sensitive and divided, hence the built-environment becomes the primary medium in which memory is preserved, negotiated or even suppressed and erased.</p>

Sarajevo was under a prolonged siege between 1992 and 1996, the longest in modern European history, with constant shelling and sniper fire, but less full-scale urban combat within the city centre, as compared to Mostar.</p>

Walls that were once perforated by bullets have been patched up, windows replaced, and facades re-rendered.</p>
                                    <p>Yet in many cases, the outlines of the original damage remain faintly visible beneath fresh plaster or paint.

                        <p class="black-text">Despite its silent testimony to the violence and fractured relationships left by the Bosnian War, architecture in post-conflict contexts can also become a powerful medium for healing and reconciliation. In Mostar, one of the most powerful examples is the reconstruction of Stari Most, a project widely heralded as a triumphant symbol of post-war unity.</p>
                        <p class="black-text">Destroyed by Croat forces in 1993, the collapse of Stari Most not only severed the two sides of the Neretva River that runs through the city but also the shared identity and ties between the Bosniak and Croat communities. When the bridge was finally rebuilt in 2004 with support from UNESCO and the international community, it was presented as more than restoring a historic structure. Instead, it was framed as an act of collective healing, a reconstruction not just of stone but of trust and memory.</p>

                        <p class="white-text grey-bg">However, architecture professor Maja Popovac argues that the meaning of the new Stari Most is more complex than its celebratory narrative suggests. The project was neither a political gesture by the international community nor a symbol aligned with a single ethnic group. Instead, it arose through local recognition of the bridge's historical and emotional significance, later supported by international funding and expertise.</p>
                        <p class="white-text grey-bg">Popovac highlights the careful negotiation needed to avoid ethnic bias in rebuilding Stari Most. An initial funding offer from Turkey raised concerns about favoring the Muslim community, prompting a broader, collaborative effort involving Bosniak and Croat groups, UNESCO, and international experts. Using original Ottoman materials and techniques, the reconstruction aimed to honour the bridge's shared cultural legacy rather than privilege any one group's narrative.</p>

                    <div class="narrative-block">
                        <p>Yet, Popovac also acknowledges the limits of architectural symbolism. While the rebuilt bridge embodies the aspiration of reconciliation, it cannot by itself mend the city's deeper wounds. Mostar remains divided by enduring social and psychological fractures. With this in mind, Stari Most is not the culmination of reconciliation, but a foundational gesture, standing as a first step in the long process of reconciliation. It holds symbolic weight not because it resolves conflict, but because it signifies the shared commitment to rebuild.</p>
                        <p>It stands as a material testament to what was broken and what is slowly being rebuilt, becoming part of the urban landscape that bears witness to war without words. As Pierre Nora would suggest, memory is not always found in what is declared but in what is endured. In this way, Stari Most remains a living witness, not to a fully healed city, but to a people that is still in the process of remembering, rebuilding and reconciling through the architecture that surrounds them.</p>

                                    <p>Henri Lefebvre argued that urban space is not just physically built but something that is socially constructed, and produced through social practices, relationships, and meanings.</p>

                                            <p>The Mostar Street Art Festival exemplifies this idea by transforming divided or neglected areas into sites of shared artistic expression. Through large-scale murals and public artworks, the festival generates new, positive meanings for spaces once marked by conflict.</p>
                                            <p>Artworks appear across both Bosniak and Croat parts of the city, encouraging physical movement, emotional engagement, and cross-ethnic interaction.

Like Stari Most in Mostar, the City Hall was destroyed during the war and later rebuilt through cross-ethnic and international collaboration.</p>
                        
                        <p>But beyond restoring its original Austro-Hungarian architecture, the building was reimagined as a civic and cultural hub, open to individuals of all ethnic and religious backgrounds.</p>

                            <p class="conclusion-text">Nearly thirty years after the war, Bosnia and Herzegovina's architecture continues to bear witness to its complex and painful past. In Sarajevo and Mostar, buildings do more than frame daily life, they quietly preserve memory. Bullet-marked facades, patched-over walls and even ruins left to decay speak to the endurance of trauma, where formal commemoration remains absent. These structures become sites of memory, not through plaques or ceremony, but through their continued presence in the urban environment.</p>

                            <p class="conclusion-text">At the same time, memory is often erased, not through denial, but through development. Redevelopment projects like the new Razvitak department store prioritise modernisation over remembrance, replacing material scars with polished surfaces. In tourist spaces, memory can be selectively curated and compressed into a marketable narrative that risk obscuring the lived experience of the conflict.</p>

                            <p class="conclusion-text">Yet, the architecture also offers space for healing. The reconstruction of Stari Most, supported by both local and international actors, stands as a symbol of a reconciliation and shared heritage. Community-led projects, artistic interventions and even deliberate decisions to preserve damaged walls show that memory can be actively remembered, not just lost.</p>

To walk its streets is to read a layered history, one that asks not only to be remembered, but to be understood, and remembered.</p>

                            <p>One of the most striking examples of silent architectural testimony is the Razvitak department store.

                        <p>The buildings of the former Yugoslavia continue to shape how the past is remembered and how the future might be envisioned. In their bullet holes and careful reconstructions, their abandonment and renewal, they offer lessons for any society learning to live with the scars of conflict.</p>
                        
                        <p>The journey continues - in every repaired wall, every preserved ruin, every shared public space where former enemies learn to coexist. Architecture, it turns out, is one of our most powerful tools for both remembering and healing.</p>
